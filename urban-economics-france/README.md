# Urban Economics: Are Larger Cities in France Better Places to Live?

This project investigates whether larger cities in France provide better living conditions by analyzing:

- Nominal and disposable income by department
- Population density
- Housing costs and amenities

## Key Findings
- Higher population density correlates with higher wages, but also higher housing costs
- Disposable income tends to be lower in dense cities despite higher nominal wages
- Positive amenities (education, culture) are more concentrated in high-density areas

## Tools
- Python, R (data wrangling, plotting)
- INSEE datasets
- Data.gouv.fr (rent estimates)
